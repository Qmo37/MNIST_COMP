# MNIST Generative Models Comparison Project

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This project implements and compares four mainstream generative models on MNIST handwritten digit generation:

1.  **VAE** (Variational Autoencoder)
2.  **GAN** (Generative Adversarial Network)
3.  **cGAN** (Conditional GAN)
4.  **DDPM** (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model)

The primary deliverable is the `MNIST_Generative_Models_Complete.ipynb` notebook, which contains all code, analysis, and visualizations in a consolidated format.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

The easiest way to run this project is to use Google Colab.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Qmo37/MNIST_COMP/blob/main/MNIST_Generative_Models_Complete.ipynb)

Simply open the notebook, select `Runtime > Run all`, and the notebook will execute from top to bottom, producing all results and visualizations.

## ðŸ“Š Performance Analysis (Real Metrics)

The following results were generated from a complete run of the notebook, calculating real performance metrics for each model.

### Key Findings
*   **Quality vs. Speed Trade-off**: DDPM produces the highest quality images but is by far the slowest. VAE is the fastest model overall but has the blurriest images.
*   **Control**: cGAN is the clear winner for controllability, as it can generate specific digits on command.
*   **Stability**: VAE and DDPM are very stable to train. GANs are notoriously unstable, though this can be mitigated.

### Qualitative Summary

| Category | VAE | GAN | cGAN | DDPM |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Image Quality** | Slightly blurred but consistent | Sharp, but potential for artifacts | Sharp and clear | Highest quality, most realistic |
| **Controllability** | Indirect (latent space) | Limited (random seed) | Excellent (class labels) | Good (can be conditional) |
| **Stability** | Very Stable | Prone to mode collapse | More stable than GAN | Very Stable |
| **Efficiency** | **Very Fast** (Train & Inference) | Moderate Train, Fast Inference | Moderate Train, Fast Inference | **Very Slow** (Train & Inference) |

**Key Observations:**
- **VAE**: Best efficiency (fastest training + inference), but lowest training stability score
- **GAN**: Fast inference (0.1 ms/img), moderate image quality
- **cGAN**: Best controllability (0.900), sharp images, fast inference
- **DDPM**: Best training stability (0.974) and quality, but extremely slow (329.6 ms/img)
