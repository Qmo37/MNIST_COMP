# MNIST Generative Models Comparison Project

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This project implements and compares four mainstream generative models on MNIST handwritten digit generation:

1.  **VAE** (Variational Autoencoder)
2.  **GAN** (Generative Adversarial Network)
3.  **cGAN** (Conditional GAN)
4.  **DDPM** (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model)

The primary deliverable is the `MNIST_Generative_Models_Complete.ipynb` notebook, which contains all code, analysis, and visualizations in a consolidated format.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

The easiest way to run this project is to use Google Colab.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Qmo37/MNIST_COMP/blob/main/MNIST_Generative_Models_Complete.ipynb)

Simply open the notebook, select `Runtime > Run all`, and the notebook will execute from top to bottom, producing all results and visualizations.

## ðŸ“Š Performance Analysis (Real Metrics)

The following results were generated from a complete run of the notebook, calculating real performance metrics for each model.

### Key Findings
*   **Quality vs. Speed Trade-off**: DDPM produces the highest quality images but is by far the slowest. VAE is the fastest model overall but has the blurriest images.
*   **Control**: cGAN is the clear winner for controllability, as it can generate specific digits on command.
*   **Stability**: VAE and DDPM are very stable to train. GANs are notoriously unstable, though this can be mitigated.

### Qualitative Summary

| Category | VAE | GAN | cGAN | DDPM |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Image Quality** | Slightly blurred but consistent | Sharp, but potential for artifacts | Sharp and clear | Highest quality, most realistic |
| **Controllability** | Indirect (latent space) | Limited (random seed) | Excellent (class labels) | Good (can be conditional) |
| **Stability** | Very Stable | Prone to mode collapse | More stable than GAN | Very Stable |
| **Efficiency** | **Very Fast** (Train & Inference) | Moderate Train, Fast Inference | Moderate Train, Fast Inference | **Very Slow** (Train & Inference) |

**Key Observations:**
- **VAE**: Best efficiency (fastest training + inference), but lowest training stability score
- **GAN**: Fast inference (0.1 ms/img), moderate image quality
- **cGAN**: Best controllability (0.900), sharp images, fast inference
- **DDPM**: Best training stability (0.974) and quality, but extremely slow (329.6 ms/img)

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

The notebook generates comprehensive visualizations comparing all four models across multiple dimensions:

### Training Curves
![Training Curves](outputs/visualizations/Training%20Curve.png)

Shows the loss progression over 40 epochs for each model:
- **VAE**: Steady convergence of reconstruction + KLD loss
- **GAN**: Generator and Discriminator losses in adversarial competition
- **cGAN**: Conditional GAN dynamics with class-aware training
- **DDPM**: Gradual diffusion loss reduction over epochs

### Performance Metrics Bar Charts

- **Clarity (Image Quality)**: Measured by FID and Inception Score
- **Training Stability**: Based on loss variance and convergence
- **Controllability**: Ability to generate specific outputs
- **Efficiency**: Training and inference speed

### Performance Heatmap

### Radar Chart
![Radar Chart](outputs/visualizations/Radar%20chart.png)

Multi-dimensional radar chart providing an intuitive visualization of how each model balances different performance aspects. The area covered by each model indicates its overall versatility:
- **DDPM**: Largest coverage (best balance)
- **cGAN**: Strong in quality and controllability
- **VAE**: Best efficiency but lower quality
- **GAN**: Moderate across all metrics

### 3D Performance Space
![3D Performance Plot](outputs/visualizations/3D%20Performance%20Plot%20(Filled%20Cuboids).png)

An interactive 3D visualization plotting models in a three-dimensional performance space:
- **X-axis**: Image Quality (Clarity)
- **Y-axis**: Training Stability
- **Z-axis**: Controllability

The plot includes color-coded performance zones (Elite, Excellent, Good) with filled cuboid regions, showing which models achieve high performance across multiple dimensions simultaneously. The golden star represents the theoretical ideal model (1.0 in all metrics).
