**Inception Score (IS)**: Higher is better - measures quality and diversity

### Normalized Performance Scores

| Model | Image Quality | Training Stability | Controllability | Efficiency |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------|
| **VAE**   | 0.483        | **0.800**             | 0.171          | **0.999**      |

### Key Findings

1. **VAE**: Best overall image quality (FID: 37.56) with excellent training stability (0.8) and fast generation
2. **GAN**: Fastest generation (0.02s) and highest inception score (3.04) but poorest image quality and controllability
3. **cGAN**: Outstanding controllability (0.962) for digit-specific generation - can reliably generate specific digits
4. **DDPM**: Balanced quality (FID: 53.15) but extremely slow (215s) making it impractical for real-time applications

---

## Metrics Calculation

### FID (Fréchet Inception Distance)
- Uses InceptionV3 network to extract 2048-dimensional features
- Compares feature distributions between real MNIST and generated samples
- Calculates Fréchet distance between Gaussian distributions
- **Lower is better** - measures how similar generated images are to real images
- All samples normalized to [-1,1] range for fair comparison

### Inception Score (IS)
- Uses InceptionV3 for classification into 10 digit classes
- Measures two properties:
  - **Quality**: How confidently the classifier recognizes generated digits
  - **Diversity**: How well all 10 digit classes are represented
- Calculated as KL divergence between conditional and marginal distributions
- **Higher is better** - mean ± std over 10 splits of 1000 samples

### Performance Score Components

**Image Quality (Normalized)**:
- Derived from FID scores
- Normalized inverse: `quality = (max_FID - model_FID) / (max_FID - min_FID)`
- Lower FID → Higher quality score

**Training Stability**:
- Analyzes loss curve characteristics:
  - Variance over training
  - Convergence rate (how quickly loss decreases)
  - Mode collapse detection (for GANs)
- Score from 0-1, higher means more stable training

**Controllability**:
- Uses Classification Accuracy Score (CAS) method
- Generates 1000 samples with specific digit labels
- Pre-trained MNIST classifier checks if generated digit matches intended label
- Score = accuracy of generated samples matching their labels
- cGAN excels here (0.962) as it's designed for conditional generation

**Efficiency**:
- Normalized inverse of generation time
- `efficiency = 1 - (model_time / max_time)`
- Faster generation → Higher efficiency
- DDPM scores 0 due to extremely slow 1000-step denoising process

## Technical Implementation Details

### Model Architectures

#### VAE (Variational Autoencoder)

```python
# Encoder: 28x28 → latent_dim=20
Conv2d(1 → 32, kernel=3, stride=2, padding=1)  # 14x14
ReLU + Conv2d(32 → 64, kernel=3, stride=2, padding=1)  # 7x7
Flatten → FC(7*7*64 → 256) → ReLU
FC(256 → latent_dim*2)  # mean and log_variance

# Decoder: latent_dim=20 → 28x28
FC(latent_dim → 256) → ReLU → FC(256 → 7*7*64)
Reshape(7,7,64) → ConvTranspose2d(64 → 32, kernel=4, stride=2, padding=1)  # 14x14
ReLU → ConvTranspose2d(32 → 1, kernel=4, stride=2, padding=1)  # 28x28
Sigmoid  # Output [0,1]
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Reparameterization trick: `z = μ + σ * ε` where `ε ~ N(0,1)`
- Loss: `BCE(reconstruction) + β * KLD(q(z|x) || p(z))` with β=1.0
- Output range: [0,1] (Sigmoid) for training with BCE
- For metrics: Convert to [-1,1] via `samples * 2 - 1`

**Why Sigmoid + BCE?**
- MNIST images are binary/grayscale [0,1]
- BCE loss interprets outputs as probabilities
- Natural fit for pixel intensities
- Stable training without gradient issues

---

#### GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)

```python
# Generator: latent_dim=100 → 28x28
FC(100 → 256) → BatchNorm → LeakyReLU(0.2)
FC(256 → 512) → BatchNorm → LeakyReLU(0.2)
FC(512 → 1024) → BatchNorm → LeakyReLU(0.2)
FC(1024 → 784) → Tanh  # Output [-1,1]
Reshape(1, 28, 28)

# Discriminator: 28x28 → 1 (real/fake)
Flatten(784) → FC(784 → 512) → LeakyReLU(0.2) → Dropout(0.3)
FC(512 → 256) → LeakyReLU(0.2) → Dropout(0.3)
FC(256 → 1) → Sigmoid  # Probability [0,1]
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Adversarial loss: `min_G max_D E[log D(x)] + E[log(1 - D(G(z)))]`
- Generator loss: `BCE(D(G(z)), ones)` - wants discriminator to output 1
- Discriminator loss: `BCE(D(x), ones) + BCE(D(G(z)), zeros)`
- BatchNorm in generator for stable gradients
- Dropout in discriminator to prevent overfitting
- LeakyReLU(0.2) to avoid dying ReLU problem

**Training Tricks:**
- Alternate training: 1 discriminator step, then 1 generator step
- Label smoothing: Real labels = 0.9 instead of 1.0
- Noise on real images to stabilize discriminator

---

#### cGAN (Conditional GAN)

```python
# Generator: latent_dim=100 + label_embedding=10 → 28x28
Label → Embedding(10 → 10) → Flatten
Concat(latent_100 + label_10 = 110)
FC(110 → 256) → BatchNorm → LeakyReLU(0.2)
FC(256 → 512) → BatchNorm → LeakyReLU(0.2)
FC(512 → 1024) → BatchNorm → LeakyReLU(0.2)
FC(1024 → 784) → Tanh  # Output [-1,1]

# Discriminator: 28x28 + label_embedding=10 → 1
Flatten(784) + Label → Embedding(10 → 10)
Concat(784 + 10 = 794)
FC(794 → 512) → LeakyReLU(0.2) → Dropout(0.3)
FC(512 → 256) → LeakyReLU(0.2) → Dropout(0.3)
FC(256 → 1) → Sigmoid
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Same adversarial training as GAN but conditioned on labels
- Label embedding: Learnable 10-dimensional representation for each digit
- Generator gets both noise and desired digit label
- Discriminator checks if image matches its label
- Enables controllable generation: "Generate a 7"

**Why cGAN has high controllability:**
- Explicitly trained to associate labels with outputs
- Can generate specific digits on demand
- Controllability score = accuracy of label matching
- Achieves 0.962 (96.2% accuracy) on generating correct digits

---

#### DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model)

```python
# U-Net Architecture: 28x28 → 28x28
# Time embedding: t → 128-dim via sinusoidal encoding
# Label embedding: 10 → 128-dim

# Downsampling path:
Conv2d(1 → 64, kernel=3, padding=1) + TimeEmbed + LabelEmbed  # 28x28
ResBlock → Conv2d(64 → 128, stride=2)  # 14x14
ResBlock → Conv2d(128 → 256, stride=2)  # 7x7
ResBlock

# Bottleneck:
ResBlock (256) → SelfAttention → ResBlock

# Upsampling path (with skip connections):
ConvTranspose2d(256 → 128, stride=2) + Skip  # 14x14
ResBlock → ConvTranspose2d(128 → 64, stride=2) + Skip  # 28x28
ResBlock → Conv2d(64 → 1, kernel=1)  # Output predicted noise
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Forward process: Gradually add Gaussian noise over T=1000 steps
  - `q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = N(√(1-β_t) * x_{t-1}, β_t * I)`
  - β_t linearly increases from 0.0001 to 0.02
- Reverse process: Neural network learns to denoise
  - Predicts noise ε_θ(x_t, t, label) at each timestep t
  - Loss: `MSE(ε_θ(x_t, t), ε)` where ε is actual noise added
- Time embedding: Sinusoidal positional encoding like Transformers
- Label embedding: For conditional generation
- U-Net with skip connections preserves spatial information

**Why DDPM is slow:**
- Must run 1000 denoising steps sequentially at inference
- Each step requires one full U-Net forward pass
- Cannot parallelize the iterative denoising process
- 1000 samples × 1000 steps = 1,000,000 network evaluations
- Explains 215s generation time vs <1s for other models

**Why DDPM has good quality:**
- Gradual denoising allows fine-grained control
- U-Net architecture with attention captures details
- Trained on all noise levels, learns robust features
- Achieves FID of 53.15 (2nd best after VAE)

---

### Training Configuration

All models trained with these hyperparameters to meet assignment requirements:

| Parameter | VAE | GAN | cGAN | DDPM |
|-----------|-----|-----|------|------|
| Batch Size | 128 | 128 | 128 | 128 |
| Optimizer | Adam | Adam (G & D) | Adam (G & D) | Adam |
| Learning Rate | 1e-3 | 2e-4 / 2e-4 | 2e-4 / 2e-4 | 1e-4 |
| Epochs | 50 | 50 | 50 | 100 |
| Loss Function | BCE + KLD | BCE (adversarial) | BCE (adversarial) | MSE (noise) |
| Latent Dim | 20 | 100 | 100 | N/A (diffusion) |

**Why different learning rates?**
- VAE: Higher LR (1e-3) safe because no adversarial training
- GAN/cGAN: Lower LR (2e-4) to stabilize adversarial dynamics
- DDPM: Lowest LR (1e-4) for fine-grained noise prediction

**Why DDPM needs 100 epochs?**
- Must learn to denoise at all 1000 timesteps
- More complex task than other models
- Longer training = better quality

---

### Code Highlights

#### VAE Sampling with Reparameterization

```python
def reparameterize(self, mu, log_var):
    """Reparameterization trick: z = μ + σ * ε"""
    std = torch.exp(0.5 * log_var)  # σ = exp(0.5 * log(σ²))
    eps = torch.randn_like(std)      # ε ~ N(0,1)
    return mu + eps * std            # z ~ N(μ, σ²)
```

**Why this trick?**
- Allows backpropagation through stochastic sampling
- Gradient flows through μ and σ, not through random ε
- Essential for training VAE with gradient descent

#### GAN Label Smoothing

```python
# Real labels = 0.9 instead of 1.0
real_labels = torch.full((batch_size,), 0.9, device=device)
fake_labels = torch.zeros(batch_size, device=device)

# Discriminator loss
real_loss = criterion(discriminator(real_images), real_labels)
fake_loss = criterion(discriminator(fake_images.detach()), fake_labels)
```

**Why label smoothing?**
- Prevents discriminator from becoming too confident
- Reduces gradient saturation
- Stabilizes adversarial training

#### DDPM Noise Schedule

```python
# Linear schedule: β increases linearly
betas = torch.linspace(0.0001, 0.02, 1000)
alphas = 1 - betas
alphas_cumprod = torch.cumprod(alphas, dim=0)  # Product of all previous alphas

# Forward diffusion at any timestep t
sqrt_alphas_cumprod = torch.sqrt(alphas_cumprod)
sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod = torch.sqrt(1 - alphas_cumprod)

x_t = sqrt_alphas_cumprod[t] * x_0 + sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod[t] * noise
```

**Clever math trick:**
- Can jump directly to any timestep t without iterating
- Precompute cumulative products for efficiency
- Training samples random timesteps uniformly
